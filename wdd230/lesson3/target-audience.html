        <p>Target audience: local business owners <br>
            <b>Persona 1:</b> Tom Wood; 52 years of age; Has owned his hardware shop for nearly thrity years and hopes to pass it down to one of his four sons. <br>
            <b>Persona 2:</b> Jackie Lofthouse; 31 years of age; Has taken her first real steps into startting her own business, so that she can work from home. <br><br>

            <b>Scenario 1:</b> Tom recognizes that times are changing, especially in the ways of business. One of his sons has helped him set up a website, but <br>
            he doesn't really know what to do from there. He hears that the Chamber of Commerce is having an event that has a workshop in social media marketing. Tom <br>
            is interested, and looks for the place, date and time on the chamber of commerce website. <br>
            <b>Scenario 2:</b> Tom enjoyed the event, and decided to look on the chamber of commerce website for more things that could help him. He found that if he became a member, <br>
            there are a lot of benefits, like getting discounts from other local business like him. Sounds like a good deal!<br>
            <b>Scenario 3:</b> Tom has had many great things come from being a member of the chamber of commerce. So much so, that he has decided to give back. With his many years <br>
            of experience and new-found knowledge: he decided to go onto the chmber of commerce website and sign up to be a mentor.<br>
            <b>Scenario 4:</b> Jackie has made great strides in starting her business, but when it comes to book keeping: she is a little overwhelmed. The upcoming <br>
            tax season has her stressed, but luckily she found on the chamber of commerce website that there will be a free class on the subject. Sounds like a good idea!<br>
            <b>Scenario 5:</b> Jackie's business is starting to slow down. She is afraid that she may have to go back to a traditional job to pay the bills. Luckily, at her class,<br>
            she found out that there are people who volunteer to be business mentors, and that she can find their names on the chamber of commerce website. <br>
